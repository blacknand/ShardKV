This `docs` directory serves as both the documentation for the project as well as any details you may be interested to know. The idea is for the docs to serve as both a guide on how to use ShardKV but also provide any information if you are interested in learning about how ShardKV works. The structure is as follows:
- `api_usage.md`: see the TCP server API usage
- `networking.md`: see the details on the TCP server implementation
