# ShardKV Server: Roadmap for Enterprise-Grade Robustness

This document lists a structured set of enhancements—across I/O, protocol, observability, data store, clustering, build, and API layers—that can transform the current proof-of-concept into a production-ready, high-performance, and maintainable distributed key-value server.

---

## 1. I/O & Concurrency

1. **Asio Strands / Executors**  
   - Serialize per-connection handlers with `asio::strand` to avoid explicit mutexes.  
   - Adopt the new Asio executor model for custom thread pools, work-stealing, or offload executors.

2. **Dedicated Thread Pool & Work Guard**  
   - Use `asio::thread_pool` or custom executor instead of manual `std::thread` loops.  
   - Employ `asio::executor_work_guard` to keep the `io_context` alive and shut it down gracefully (e.g. on SIGINT).

3. **Backpressure & Rate Limiting**  
   - Implement a token-bucket or leaky-bucket per connection to prevent floods.  
   - Slow-path or drop requests when a client exceeds rate limits.

4. **Zero-Copy Buffer Management**  
   - Replace `std::vector<char>` with pooled `asio::mutable_buffer`s.  
   - Use a lock-free or TBB buffer pool to reduce allocations and improve cache locality.

---

## 2. Protocol & Framing

1. **Length-Prefixed Framing**  
   - Prepend every message with a fixed-size header (e.g. 4-byte length).  
   - Use `async_read` to consume exactly the declared number of bytes.

2. **Binary Wire Format**  
   - Define a compact C-style header (e.g. command ID, key-length, value-length).  
   - Serialize fields in network byte order to minimize parsing overhead.

3. **Protocol Versioning**  
   - Embed a 1-byte version in every frame for forward/backward compatibility.  
   - Fall back to older handlers when version mismatches occur.

---

## 3. Error Handling & Observability

1. **Structured Logging**  
   - Swap out `std::cerr` for a library (spdlog / Boost.Log / glog).  
   - Emit JSON logs with fields: timestamp, conn_id, cmd, latency_us, status.  
   - Support log levels, rotation, and external sinks (files, syslog, ELK).

2. **Metrics & Tracing**  
   - Integrate Prometheus C++ client counters/histograms:  
     - Request rates (GET/PUT/DELETE)  
     - Latency percentiles  
     - Active connection count  
     - KV-store hit/miss ratio  
   - Instrument OpenTelemetry spans around each async operation for end-to-end tracing.

3. **Robust Error Paths**  
   - In every callback, inspect `boost::system::error_code`.  
   - Map known errors (eof, connection_reset) to clean shutdown.  
   - Report unexpected errors as alerts and return structured error codes to clients.

---

## 4. Data Store & Concurrency

1. **Lock-Free / Sharded KVStore**  
   - Replace `std::mutex`‐guarded map with a striped-lock or lock-free concurrent map (Folly, TBB).  
   - Allow full parallelism across multiple cores.

2. **Persistence & Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**  
   - Append each mutation to a thread-local WAL buffer; flush asynchronously.  
   - Replay log on startup to rebuild in-memory state.  
   - Take periodic snapshots to truncate the WAL.

3. **Replication & Consensus**  
   - Integrate a Raft/Paxos library (e.g. libraft) for multi-node replication.  
   - Handle leader election, heartbeats, and log replication.

---

## 5. Cluster Management

1. **Consistent Hashing Ring**  
   - Finalize `ConsistentHash` to distribute keys across nodes.  
   - Support dynamic joins/leaves with minimal data movement.

2. **Failure Detection & Rebalancing**  
   - Use TCP timeouts or a gossip protocol to detect node failures.  
   - Trigger automatic rebalancing of affected key ranges.

3. **Admin API**  
   - Expose REST or gRPC endpoints for cluster introspection, health checks, and manual reconfiguration.

---

## 6. Build, Testing & Deployment

1. **Modern CMake**  
   - Use `target_link_libraries(shardkv PRIVATE Boost::asio Boost::system)`.  
   - Fetch or find dependencies via `FetchContent` / `find_package`.  
   - Export a CMake config for client integration.

2. **Unit & Integration Tests**  
   - GoogleTest suites for `KVStore`, `ConsistentHash`.  
   - Mock Asio sockets to simulate network errors/timeouts.  
   - E2E tests in Docker Compose, load-tested with `wrk` or `redis-benchmark`.

3. **CI/CD & Static Analysis**  
   - Run clang-tidy, AddressSanitizer, UBSan on every PR.  
   - Gate merge on ≥90% test coverage for critical modules.  
   - Publish Docker multi-arch images for easy rollout.

---

## 7. API & Client SDKs

1. **gRPC Front-End**  
   - Define a `shardkv.proto` service to replace the custom TCP protocol.  
   - Leverage HTTP/2 multiplexing, TLS, and built-in retries.

2. **Multi-Language SDKs**  
   - Generate C++, Python, Go, Java client stubs.  
   - Provide high-level wrappers (futures/promises, async/await).

---

### Prioritization Roadmap

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1–2)**  
   - Framing + strands + structured logging + CMake polish.  
2. **Scalability (Weeks 3–6)**  
   - Sharded lock-free map + WAL persistence + metrics.  
3. **Enterprise (Months 2–4)**  
   - Distributed consensus (Raft) + gRPC front-end + CI/CD + SDKs.

Each bullet here represents a non-trivial engineering effort—pick and combine them to evolve ShardKV from a demo server into a battle-hardened distributed store. Happy building!
